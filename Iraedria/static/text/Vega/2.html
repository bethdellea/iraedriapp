<p>Rune had made the
unusual habit of falling asleep early, despite his encroaching adolescence. His
mind was growing, and as it grew, his worries grew along with it. He found it
easier to fall asleep to the sounds of his father and brother moving about than
in the emptiness of a silent house. On the night that it all began, when he
woke to the comfortable sounds of shuffling and Corona speaking softly from the
kitchen, he thought at first that he had not fallen asleep at all. His sixth
sense awakened more slowly than his ears. At the very moment he became aware of
an unfamiliar disturbance in the ambient magic, he heard a new voice that was
loud and demanding.</p>
<p>He did not stir.
Corona responded to the demand in the same calm voice as he had used before. Rune
read the way that the magic in the air moved around six unknown bodies, like
magical echolocation, to alert him of the strangers in his household.</p>
<p>When he opened his
eyes and pulled the covers away from his face, his room was still dark. He
reached out in the direction of a clock and breathed out the gentlest lick of
fire, warming it in his chest before sending it through his arm and out of his fingertips.
The hour hand was somewhere in the top left quadrant of the clock face. Rune
buried his head under the covers again, trying to block out the sounds of voices
he did not recognize, trying not to notice the discomfort in his father’s
voice. Despite his reluctance, he strained his ears to listen, but his mind
raced too quickly to hold onto any words until he felt familiar stomps in the
hallway outside his door and his brother shouted, “What the hell is going on?!”</p>
<p>His heart pounded
against his ribs. His breathing was quick and shallow; the air under his sheets
grew hot. Faenon kept yelling, and now Corona was yelling, and Corona never
yelled, and the strange men were yelling, too, and something heavy fell over
and there was a smash of broken glass and a splatter of water—the wash basin,
with dishes inside—and everyone started shouting “no” and “stop” until
something softer than a wooden wash basin, but even heavier, hit the floor. The
last thing Rune heard from Corona—and he barely knew it was Corona, because it
was a scream—was, “<i>Get Althea!</i>”</p>
<p>Rune clasped his
hands over the top of his head and shoved his face into a pillow to stifle a
yelp. Tears bled into his pillowcase as he bit through the fibers, shaking too
violently to control his motions. He sank his untidy fingernails into his scalp
in utter hatred of a self that was too afraid to leave his room when his father
needed him. </p>
<p>His opinion of
himself began with a thought pattern. With repetition, it became an attitude;
with time, it manifested as a feeling, a physical condition inseparable from
his state of being. It was the headache, the nausea, the sour taste in his
mouth, but most of all, it was the heavy weight that held him inert and that
pressed down harder on him each second he refused to move.</p>
<p>If he stayed silent
and still, no one would find him. The conflict would come to an end, no matter
how gruesome. Even if, by his negligence, Faenon and Corona were killed,
everyone would say to him that there was nothing that he could have done. Every
time he might try to confess his cowardice, they would tell him not to blame
himself, he was so young when it happened. But Corona and Faenon would remember
how loudly they had called for help that night, and if there were an afterlife,
they would spend eternity in loathing of the leechlike half-elf that they
regretted ever letting into their home.</p>
<p>Rune hated himself
out of his bed. Keeling over his sickened stomach, he fumbled with the lock on
his door with shaking fingers before ramming open his door with a bony hip—the
lock never held under pressure—and stumbled into the hallway. He ran blind into
the kitchen; all he could see through the darkness and his tears were the
shadows of too many people. The room smelled like iron. His bare foot splashed into
something warm and wet.</p>
<p>“Rune, no,” Corona
shouted.</p>
<p>There were hands all
over Corona’s body. The shadows glistened in moonlight and moved with the sound
of clinking metal, not quite towards Rune but downwards. He had stepped in a
small, dark pool that, even in the blue sheen of midnight, had a reddish hue,
in which a body lay. After a blink, Rune saw his brother’s dirty blond curls.
Another blink showed him that hands were clamoring over Faenon’s body, too.</p>
<p>Corona fought against
the arms holding him back. “Don’t <i>touch </i>him!” he yelled. “Leave them out
of this! They don’t know anything about the Vessel!”</p>
<p>“The kid’s going to
die if you leave him here,” said a voice that had a crisp echo against the
metal that muffled it.</p>
<p>Rune could no longer
see at all. His legs failed to take another step forward. In the back of his
head, to where his conscious mind escaped to put as much distance between
himself and reality as possible, he recognized the sensation of his limbs
losing their feeling. When he was younger, his spells of terror whirled his
magic into the same uncontrollable frenzy, unleashing wild flickers of fire. His
head grew thick with the swell of magic. When he tasted its texture, he
squeezed his eyes shut in fear of what havoc he would wreak.</p>
<p>As a half-elf, he was
the heir of magics both human and elven. His most impressive spells—distortions
in space that could move or deflect solid objects—required both types of magic working
in tandem. They waged war in his small body and came out united in a volume too
great for him to control. He needed to calm down or risk destroying his
surroundings in a flaming, psychokinetic whirlwind, but he also needed to make
his way to the Rider house in the middle of the night before all of the blood
seeped out of Faenon’s body, meaning that what he really needed was to turn
back time and hit himself in the face until he stopped being such a useless
screw-up.</p>
<p>He seized what
control he could over the magic and pushed. His knees hit the ground as he
gasped for air he did not realize he needed. His body cried for it, for sleep,
for food, for something to replace the energy it had lost. His arms and
shoulders burned in all of the places where magic had seeped out of them.</p>
<p>The unfamiliar voices
died away. Rune felt the sticky, warm liquid against his cheek. Every gasp he
took was poisoned by the stench of blood. He realized the ringing in his ears
was not in his head when he heard Althea commenting on it. “What the hell is
that noise?” she demanded. “Kari, get the light.”</p>
<p>Rune opened his eyes
one at a time and believed for a moment that he might have been dreaming. Floating
in the air above him were strange tears, as if rent into an invisible fabric
hanging over his reality. Beyond the tears were different places: his bedroom
was beyond one, the grassy stretch behind the school was another. Each ugly
window rang with its own ear-piercing shriek, especially the ones leading to
something so black he thought he might be sucked in if he came too close.</p>
<p>In one of the slashed
holes, he saw himself staring back, as if looking into a fragment of a mirror.
He was coated in the sheen of sweat, half of his face painted with blood,
looking exhausted and pitiful. The blood was splattered on the opposite side of
his face from where he felt it coagulating on his skin—the same side, if they
were not mirror images. He saw his double gasp just after he did, before their
window shriveled up into nothing, as if it had never existed.</p>
<p>A flash came from a
different hole in the sky, and Rune recognized the interior of the Rider
daughters’ bedroom: the vanity topped with hair ribbons and folded sweaters,
the bookshelf of medical textbooks and ancient fairytales, the war-weary combat
shoes and the tiny cloth boots beside it. Kari grabbed both pairs, a lamp
hooked on her elbow, while Althea’s close voice muttered, “It’s coming from
somewhere around here.”</p>
<p>This window was the
largest of those he had torn open, and it swelled larger still when he focused
on it. His feet slid through blood when he tried to stand, and his arms were
far too weak to push himself upright. He did not have the luxury of enough
coordination to hesitate before he plunged his hand inside the portal.</p>
<p>Althea screamed when
he half-appeared in her bedroom. She screamed again when he grabbed her hand
and pulled it towards him. He fixed his eyes on Kari, fervently hoping to
project the state of his mind onto her being. She ran to the corner of her room
where she kept her bow and quiver and where Althea kept a bag of medical
supplies. She always understood him better when he was in a panic.</p>
<p>His body protested when
he tugged Althea through his portal, telling him just how much magic he had
expended. He usually felt a strange tingling in his veins when he used a high
volume of energy in a short amount of time, but it was always temporary. The
ache he felt now was of desperate fatigue, threatening to pull him to the
ground in collapse. He gripped Althea’s arm and fell against her to stay
upright when she crossed over to his side.</p>
<p>The other portals
were beginning to shrink at uneven rates. The green glow at their corners
reminded him of burning paper curling into soot. The spectacle dazed Althea,
who, by the sight of her cotton nightgown, had been asleep only moments prior. Rune’s
vision began to fade as he watched the final remaining portal dwindle away with
Kari on the other side of it. He never saw how she squeezed through the tiny
hole, but the light of her lamp illuminated his closed eyelids when the
strident hum of the portal vanished. She grabbed hold of him when Althea swore
and fell to her knees in the pool of blood.</p>
<p>In his right hand,
Faenon clasped a slice of a smashed plate so tightly it scraped the tender skin
between his calluses. Another shard was sticking out of his skin in the place
where his neck met his left shoulder. His eyes were wide open with just enough
cognizance to feel the jagged, rough edges of broken ceramic pressing into his
body. Blood covered the floor from his wound to well past the top of his head.
He held a hand smeared in his blood to Althea’s face when he recognized her,
mouthing words he could not put a voice to.</p>
<p>What remained of
Rune’s magic once again stirred in terror. Kari must have felt it in his aura,
because she was dragging him away across the floor, back towards his room. At
the time, he was too weary to fight against her pull, and what a relief it was
to watch his worries disappear before his eyes. After she propped him against
the wall, she scurried past him towards Althea. “Bleeding fast, but it’s not as
bad as it looks,” Althea was saying. “There must have been water on the floor,
that’s what spread it out like this.”</p>
<p>“Th-the wash bin,”
Kari said. She cast a shaking light upon it with her lamp.</p>
<p>“Put that down near
me and put your fingers here and here for a second,” Althea ordered. “It’ll
gush when I pull this thing out. Got him right in the jugular.”</p>
<p>Althea was calm, but
it did not keep the dread from returning to Rune’s stomach. When the visceral
terror of seeing his brother in mortal peril faded, he felt the air desperately
for the signature of Corona Winter’s aura, or of any other aura beyond the
house. He crawled closer to the back door, listening so intently that he could
feel the sleeping bodies of villagers on the border of Azier. Tears streamed
from his eyes as he strained to see something from the other direction, from
Lucusia, the desolate forest beyond the farm.</p>
<p>“Rune,” said Kari,
but he could barely see her when she was right beside him, focused as he was on
his second sight. “Althea says he’s—he’ll be okay, she can—she wanted to know where—is
Corona here, or—?”</p>
<p>They would all tell
him it was not his fault, that there was nothing he could have done to save his
father. Even Faenon would nod in agreement, but there would be a crease in his
brow as he stared down his little brother long after the conversation topic had
changed, as if to say, “But at least I tried. Why didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Uh, um, Rune,” Kari
stammered when he clawed his way up the wall to stand. “You shouldn’t—you
should sit down, I think—your aura is really faint, I don’t know…”</p>
<p>The back door was
weak when he pushed it open. There were splinters at the hinges and a chunk of
wood missing near where the deadbolt fit into the doorframe. A wide path
through the tall grass in the yard had been stomped flat from the door to the
tree line. He felt the cold dew of a warming night under his toes as he trudged
forward.</p>
<p>Kari hopped behind
him on one foot as she struggled to pull her second boot on. “Rune, you should
really,” she began, then glanced at the cottage behind her. “Althea says you
should… Did you—did you bring us here? Was that how—your magic, you… You should
stay inside, you don’t have much energy and you might…”</p>
<p>He could barely feel
the fatigue of magic loss anymore. All that remained was a chill in his heart
that told him he was empty and the still-burning complaint from the exhausted
pathways by which his magic had escaped his body.  </p>
<p>He caught a sudden,
unnatural swell of yet another unfamiliar aura.</p>
<p>It started out so
faint that he was sure he was imagining it, but quickly grew resolute. Then,
just as suddenly as it had appeared, it faded back into nothingness. Then,
again, it returned, just as strong as it had been before. It came, without a
doubt, from deeper in the woods.</p>
<p>“R—Rune,” Kari
stuttered. “W-where are you going? What… what <i>happened? </i>Where’s…?”</p>
<p>“There’s someone
there,” Rune whispered.</p>
<p>“There’s… where?”
Kari glanced around nervously. “Who?”</p>
<p>The push of the air
from this distant aura pressed against Rune’s insides. It felt like a cold wind
bringing news of a nearby storm. By reading the ripples in the ambient magic,
Rune could detect these faraway presences where Kari and Althea were blind.
From the way they described their ability to sense auras, Rune had discovered
that they only felt for the higher concentration of personal magic, which never
extended beyond more than a few feet from a person. By the width and fuzz of the
signal from the forest, the aura could have been a mile or more away, much
farther than the Riders could see.</p>
<p>“We have to—we have
to go right now, don’t we?” Kari realized. “I’ll—I’ll tell Althea, I’ll get
everything—you should wait here, and—and rest for a second, I’ll…”</p>
<p>What the Riders
sacrificed in distance, they made up for in acuity in close range. Althea could
read a heartbeat and temperature in an aura, and Rune still did not understand the
extent of what Kari could read or how, but soon she would wear a change of
her clothes that she should have remembered storing in the barn, but were
instead in Rune’s room, buried underneath his dresser.</p>
<p>He did not wait and
rest. As soon as Kari disappeared into the house, Rune trudged on towards the
line of trees at the end of the farmland. Corona had told his sons to never
trespass there; to cross into the trees was to enter another country. Lucusia
was a lawless land, home to legends of coldblooded criminals and tales to
frighten children into obedience. Faenon had to wait until he was fifteen years
old before Corona permitted him to approach the border to chop trees for
firewood. The world felt colder when Rune’s toes touched Lucusian soil.</p>
<p>He moved slowly,
touching the trunk of each tree he passed for support. The adrenaline in his
veins was losing its potency and sinking, trickling down into his aching feet
and making each step heavier. The aura should have been coming into clearer focus
the farther he walked, but he was too tired to listen with intent to the fluctuating
signal. After a stiff twig pierced the tender skin in the arch of his foot, he
dropped to one bare knee in the dirt, leaned against the nearest tree, and
tried to fight the overwhelming urge to cry. He lost that fight.</p>
<p>Between quiet,
shuddering sobs, Rune felt the aura moving closer to him. He had never felt magic
move around someone the way it swirled around this stranger, frenzied as if
encountering an unnatural disturbance in the world. The person behind that aura
could no doubt sense Rune at this distance, so Rune concentrated on fading away.
He listened carefully for his own aura, the signature that the air made around
his energy. He moved his magic around inside of himself until the signal became
softer, if not weaker. The proper practice was to inject energy into the air in
a way that neutralized the signal, but he lacked the strength to completely
disappear. He practiced this quieting technique daily to blend the harsh edges
of his half-elven aura into the background noise of humans in Azier.</p>
<p>A dark eternity
later, an even more jarring presence glowed on the horizon behind him. She
could barely hear her own aura, let alone hide it.</p>
<p>“Rune!” Kari called.
“Rune, I—we—we…”</p>
<p>Her speech dissolved
into panting; she had sprinted all the way. She had changed from her
nightclothes into the mismatched outfit she left at the Winters’ in case her
clothes were stained during battles, including a pale green cardigan she had
outgrown by years. Between her gasps, she started to ask him why he had left,
but stopped as soon as they decided he did not have an answer.</p>
<p>“Althea and Faenon…
they’re—she—they’re coming, they…” She paused for another breath, leaning on
her hands. “Faenon said that… he was saying—I didn’t… hear everything, I just
started getting the…”</p>
<p>On her shoulder was Rune’s
backpack, sinking in a different shape than the one his books gave it. A layer
of chain mail covered her clothes under her short cardigan, around which she
fastened the belt that held her bow and quiver. She handed Rune his shoes.
Inside each was a sock; they almost matched.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a sweater
and your mail armor and,” Kari went on, thumbing over her shoulder at the
backpack, “and pants, in my—in your…”</p>
<p>“Can you see that
aura?” Rune whispered.</p>
<p>Kari went stiff
except in the neck, which she jerked about. “Wh—aura? I can’t…”</p>
<p>Rune pointed. “It’s
been there for,” he began, but his sense of time was too distorted to tell the
duration. “They’re probably close enough to hear you talking.”</p>
<p>She stared after his
finger. She pulled her feet under her one at a time, then wiped her hands on
her patterned, knee-length skirt before cupping them around her mouth and calling,
“Is somebody there?”</p>
<p>Rune managed one
barely voiced “no” but the rest were only mouthed. He stumbled to his feet,
swinging his body behind the trunk of a tree. Thin though he was, he could not
hide himself among the slender birches.</p>
<p>Kari grabbed his arm
without looking. The fingers she had trained through archery made a terrifying
vice. He felt the tough leather of her two-fingered shooting glove pressing
into his skin. “I—I feel it now,” she breathed. “Is he coming closer?”</p>
<p>With a violent jerk,
Rune snapped his arm free of her grip, stuffing his feet into his shoes and the
socks into his fists. He was standing and wriggling his heel into his right shoe
when Kari gasped and pointed in the direction of the ever-stronger aura. Between
the trees was the long, thin shadow of a man.</p>
<p>A gravelly,
world-weary voice reached them through the trees. “You two better get out of
here,” he warned.</p>
<p>Though Rune was eager
to follow this advice, Kari barely stirred. “Hello?” she called back. “Who’s…
who’s there?”</p>
<p>As the man marched
closer, moonlight struck his eyes and made them gleam like a wolf’s. His aura
flared out in one last cold wind that sent a chill down Rune’s spine. Rune
froze, staring at the ground and breathing hard. The breaths came out cold.</p>
<p>“What the hell?” the
man muttered. “How old <i>are </i>you? It’s the middle of the night, what are
you kids doing out here?”</p>
<p>When he realized he
loomed over the children by at least two feet, he stepped back, and Rune found
the nerve to lift his eyes. He lingered awhile on the shape of a sword hanging
from the man’s belt, the pommel of which he cupped in his palm. His face was
white and gaunt with high, sharp cheekbones, contoured by stubble at his
jawline and dark hair on his chin and sideburns. Under the furrow in his brow
was a strong nose with an uneven bridge. He looked down it at Rune with icy
blue eyes weighed down by black bags.</p>
<p>“Is that <i>blood?</i>”
he asked. Rune still had it all over his face, his hands, and his feet.</p>
<p>“Um,” Kari began
nervously, looking to Rune for approval. “We were… we’re… I think something
really bad happened.”</p>
<p>“Oh, hell,” he
uttered. “Are you two half-elves?”</p>
<p>The night went white.</p>
<p>A moment later, Rune
was gripping the knitting of Kari’s sleeves with clammy, white fingers, pressing
his head to her back. He pulled his elbows to his stomach and crouched behind
her, unconsciously eliminating the signal of his aura, in a futile attempt to
disappear.</p>
<p>“I’m—we’re not,” Kari
blubbered, holding her cold hands over Rune’s. “We’re not, we, we both have
these weird, I mean, I think I do, I have the weird aura that people say, the
double aura, people say that’s what—what they have, because the two magics, but
I have it and—”</p>
<p>“Hey, you’ll pass out
if you keep talking without breathing,” the man teased. “I don’t care what you
are, you need to get out of here. The mercs were just here.”</p>
<p>His words did not,
and could not, quell Rune’s nerves. He pushed away when Kari moved nearer,
shaking and sweating, unable to open his mouth without fear of vomiting. In the
heat of the moment, he hated Kari for her aura. It shone in two distinct
colors, as Rune’s did when he did not control it. Rune’s echo presence came
from his two different sources of magic, one elven and one human, but he knew
how to blend them into one nondescript signature. Despite being human, Kari had
an even starker separation between the two halves of her aura than Rune. Her
lack of aura control had given Rune away. On top of that, she could not tell a
lie to save his life.</p>
<p>“Who was here?” Kari
asked in a weak voice.</p>
<p>“The mercenaries.
Vega’s,” said the man. “If you’ve never heard of them, all the better. Run home
and keep it that way.”</p>
<p>“N-no, wait,” Kari
stuttered. “The mercenaries, did they—do they wear plate armor?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, red metal,”
replied the man.</p>
<p>“Did they have someone
else with them?” she asked desperately. “He’s—um, he’s got brown hair and eyes,
and—”</p>
<p>“Wait, you know the
man they took?” the man asked.</p>
<p>Rune stopped
breathing. “It’s his dad,” Kari said with a nod.</p>
<p>The man gave Rune a
fierce stare with his icy eyes. “Kid,” he said, “you need to get out of here. Now.”</p>
<p>“<i>Rune! Kari!</i>”</p>
<p>Rune jumped at the
sound of his brother’s voice. Panic overwhelmed any relief he felt to see the
shadows of Althea and Faenon approaching from behind. He was not used to people
sneaking up on him.</p>
<p>“Who the hell is
that?” Faenon yelled, pointing as he stomped forward.</p>
<p>“Slow down, you ass,”
Althea grumbled.</p>
<p>Rune saw the visual
explanation for her imperceptible aura when he squinted into the darkness. A
breath away from breathless, she rested her arm across Faenon’s shoulders, head
hanging low. Faenon, on the other hand, moved with an energy so fierce that
Rune forgot, for a moment, that he had been gravely injured only minutes ago.</p>
<p>“Faenon!” Kari called
back. “He saw the people who took Corona!”</p>
<p>“Okay, ‘saw’ is a
very generous word for what I did,” muttered the man.</p>
<p>Throwing her arm from
his neck, Faenon abandoned Althea beside a narrow birch that bent when she
leaned against its trunk. His axe swung in the straps attaching it to his
backpack when he sprinted. He stopped short of the stranger when he noticed a
considerable height difference between them.</p>
<p>“When did you see
them? How far off are they?” Faenon demanded. “Which way?”</p>
<p>“I’m not too sure I
want to tell you.” The man lifted his hand and illuminated a small pocket of
electric blue magic in his palm to cast light on Faenon’s young face. “I’m not
that keen on leading a bunch of children to their deaths.”</p>
<p>Faenon tensed all of
his muscles to keep himself from charging forward. “Who the hell do you think
you are?” he shouted. “That’s my <i>dad </i>they took, you self-righteous
bastard.”</p>
<p>“Rune, if you could
try to stop him from punching anybody before I can get there, that’d be great,”
Althea groaned from afar, trudging along from tree to tree.</p>
<p>There was no danger of
physical violence from Faenon as long as he kept his eye on the foot-high gap
between his head and the stranger’s. It was a question of how long this man
could stand to be shouted at.</p>
<p>“You’re literally
covered in blood. Both of you,” said the man with a glance at Rune. “I don’t
know how you kids are even moving, but you’d better stop before it kills you.
I’m pretty handy with sewing stitches if you need.”</p>
<p>Faenon shoved him
away when he came to take a closer look. “I’m <i>fine,</i>” he snapped. “Go to
hell.”</p>
<p>“You’re <i>welcome,</i>”
Althea called from several yards back.</p>
<p>“I woke up to the
sound of my dad being <i>dragged </i>from my house, got stabbed in the neck by
those bastards,” Faenon went on, “and walked all this goddamn way with two
hundred pounds on my back—”</p>
<p>“Screw you, I’m not
that heavy and I was barely leaning on you,” Althea muttered. She had almost
made it there; Rune could feel what was left of her aura. It had taken a lot
out of her to bring Faenon back to health.</p>
<p>“—so if you think I’m
gonna turn back now just because you say so, you better think the hell again,”
Faenon said through his teeth. “Tell me where they went, <i>now.</i>”</p>
<p>Kari winced at each
of the foul words that Faenon spat. He usually kept his tongue clean around her
ears.</p>
<p>The man held the
light in his palm closer to Faenon. “Stabbed in the neck?” he asked. “Where?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, I told
you.” Faenon clapped a hand over the gentle bruise that remained. “Are you
going to tell me where they went or not?!”</p>
<p>“Not if all this
blood is from your neck,” said the man, holding up both his hands and squaring
his stance. “I’m not joking, I think you’re going to die if you don’t—”</p>
<p>“For the last time, I’m
<i>fine! </i>I swear, if you don’t tell me right now,” he threatened, gripping
the haft of his axe.</p>
<p>Rune stared at the
axe. Even encased in its leather sheath, it had a lethal mass if swung with the
full force of Faenon’s rage. Rune did not have the magic left to stop its
trajectory.</p>
<p>The stranger’s face
fell into creases of disdain. “Did you get knocked around in the head, or are
you just always this insufferable?”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>Althea’s eyes went
wide. “Oh, hell.”</p>
<p>Faenon whipped his
head around to face her and ask the same question, but it morphed into a quiet
“ow” as he held his fingers to his eyes.</p>
<p>“Thought your pupils
looked funny,” said the man. In a single, long stride, he was at Faenon’s side.
“Alright, sit down slowly and we’ll see if I can help you out. My name’s
Daion.”</p>
<p>“Althea,” Faenon said
weakly, holding his head in both hands as he sank to the ground, supported at
the elbows by Daion, whose head shot up at the sound of her name.</p>
<p>“I’m coming, you big
baby.” Althea dropped to her knees with a hefty sigh, holding her hands to his
head. The soft blue light of her magic glowed brighter in the night, emanating
from her palms in shaky flickers.</p>
<p>“You’re the healer,”
Daion uttered.</p>
<p>Althea gave him a
glance and nothing more.</p>
<p>“You healed his
wounds,” he said. “You… can heal head injuries?”</p>
<p>“Well enough,” she
mumbled.</p>
<p>As she combed through
Faenon’s hair, matted with blood, to inspect the damage in and under his skull,
Daion sat in silence, staring vacantly at her hands.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you from
Azier?” he said at last. “All of you. So you’re training to be warriors and all.”</p>
<p>“What’s it to you?”
Faenon grumbled.</p>
<p>Daion turned his head
over his shoulder. He eyed Kari first, then stared at Rune.</p>
<p>“Here’s what I can
do,” he decided. “Soon as you’re ready, we’ll start following the mercs from a
distance. I’ll cover everyone’s auras so they can’t tell we’re here. If we get
a chance, if they drop their guard—<i>only</i> if we get that chance—then we’ll
go in and try to take your man back.”</p>

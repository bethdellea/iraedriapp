<p>A sign of the
times was encased in metal and placed on the front desk when the children of
Azier filed in for their first history class of the school year. Faenon’s
father once had a lamp just like it, but it now lay with the clutter in the old
barn after something inside of it broke and it never illuminated again. This
lamp, a sleeker style, had a faint flame that flickered, as all such lamps did,
without a wick, suspended in midair above an iridescent stone mounted in the
base.  </p>
<p>A man with a
grin more oily than his hair watched proudly while his students gawked at the
device from no nearer than two feet away. When the classroom had filled, he
held the lamp, which he called an elven light, close to his face to demonstrate
its glow in the daylight that filtered through the dusty windows. With the
flick of a switch, the man turned it off, then on again, to audible gasps.</p>
<p>“I thought
I’d start the first day of our Human-Elven Relations class by sharing this new
technology with you,” said the man, whose name was written in chalk behind him,
but Faenon could not read it from the back of the classroom. “The elven light
is a beautiful symbol for what humans and elves can accomplish when we work
together.”</p>
<p>“Can you pass
it around?” asked a voice next to Faenon that belonged to one of the few elves
in Azier. There were three that he knew, all named Itonami, and they hung out
almost exclusively with each other. They had wrestled their way past the Azier
gates a year ago and taken up residence there ever since. The two girls were
twins aged eleven, and one was never without the other. They had identical rosy
faces and always dressed in the style of rich city ladies, but could be
differentiated by the color that crept into their fine, white hair: pale
streaks of blue for one, and tips of violet for the other. The only reason
anyone confused one for the other was because their names were Zuli and Yuli,
and no one could remember which twin was which. </p>
<p>The man's
smile faltered for only an instant, after which it seemed even falser. He
reluctantly handed the elven light to someone in the first row. As he talked
about his personal background in the brief history of elves and humans, he gripped the edge of his desk and leered at the students
mishandling his light.
He hardly had to tell the students he was an Azierite who had studied in
Meryville. He had the haughty air of a Gardenian, as did all who lived too long in the capital city of
Gardena, especially those who studied at the university. Only a man who had
once been an Azierite would dare return to Azier, a village surrounded by stone
walls, watched by guards,  and filled to the brim with warriors eager for
blood.</p>
<p>Those
unfamiliar with elven lights barely touched the lamp when it came to their
seat, as if afraid. It arrived at last at Faenon's desk with the whisper,
"It smells like blood."</p>
<p>The scent told
him that the lamp was cast in iron. The lingering chill in his fingertips after
he passed it on to his left told him something he already knew, but could not
articulate, about Gardena.</p>
<p>“We’re going to start
today’s lesson at the very beginning,” the teacher said. “It’s been… what, fourteen
years, hasn’t it? Can any of you remember the Celestial Event?”</p>
<p>Faenon alone raised
his hand. He was seventeen years old, placing him among the dwindling few in
the oldest class at Azier’s school. If not for his father, he would never have
stayed so long, not when most of his peers had left to follow their parents
into trades or to take their schooling in war to the Northern Army. Though
bright, motivated, and a quick learner, Faenon had never liked school. He could
not tolerate the artificial power dynamic between student and teacher, for
which his father often blamed himself. The only reason he had seen the
Celestial Event was because he had disobeyed and wandered away from a teacher
that day. She had been herding the children into the school’s underground
shelter to hide from the green planet that had appeared on the horizon and
started to glow.</p>
<p>“Oh, so we’ve got
one!” said the teacher, brimming with energy. “I might ask you a few questions
about it, if you don’t mind. What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Faenon. Faenon
Winter,” he replied, watching his teacher’s face fall.</p>
<p>Faenon looked like a
nice enough boy if one did not notice his smug grin and the glint of mischief
in his brown eyes. He had a youthful face for seventeen years: a strong but
hairless jawline under round cheeks, framed by unkempt curls of dirty blonde,
with a bit of a snub nose. He never had a height advantage, but discipline with
his great battle axe gave him the strength he needed to stand tall no matter
whom he faced. By the time he reached his preteen years, he noticed that new
teachers reacted viscerally to hearing his name, presumably because they had
been warned.</p>
<p>“Faenon,” repeated
this new teacher with disgust. “Well, did you want to share anything about your
experience?”</p>
<p>Faenon beamed with
his signature grin and shrugged. “Not really,” he said. “You probably remember
it better than I do.”</p>
<p>“Fair enough,” he
responded on a sigh, perhaps one of relief.</p>
<p>He launched back into
his lesson as swiftly as possible by recounting what little the University’s
best scientists knew about the Celestial Event. Faenon might have paid
attention if the University’s best scientists could explain any more than what
the general public already knew: for some reason, an alien planet crossed paths
with theirs, and an atmospheric reaction brought those aliens, called elves, to
the surface of Iraedria. Instead, Faenon picked up on the thread of the
whispered conversation next to him, after which point he could not let it go.</p>
<p>“It feels unstable.
It’s not cleaved,” said the Itonami twin to his immediate left, the violet-haired
one. “Stupid cheap Gardenian knockoffs.”</p>
<p>She and her sister
huddled at her desk, examining the elven light. “What do we do?” said the
blue-haired one. “He’s watching us. We can’t just take it apart right here
and—”</p>
<p>“You do it, Yuli.
I’ll cover you. I’m getting Raz,” said the purple twin, closing her eyes with a
grimace.</p>
<p>Not a moment later,
the third and final elf in Azier waved his dainty, white hand in the air. “Wait, I have a
question!”</p>
<p>Though Faenon
didn’t like to notice the similarities, he and Raz were much alike. Both were
in their last year of school, neither was afraid to redirect a lesson plan, and
each hated the other’s way of doing it. Raz and Faenon avoided conversation as
much as possible, but they shared a mutual friend, so they had rubbed against
each other many times.</p>
<p>“Yes?” the teacher answered with disdain,
not only because of the abrupt interruption, but also because Raz had an
appearance that invited disdain. Though his cousins Zuli and Yuli also had
unusually colored hair, his beat theirs out with a bright shade of bubblegum
pink, which he attested was, like theirs, completely natural. Every day, he
wore his patchwork jacket of heavily pigmented cotton squares. His posture was
one of forced perfection, with an upright spine, legs crossed at the ankle, and
hands resting gently on the clean, high-quality paper of his notebook, next to
which he placed his small bottle of ink and his black feather quill. Every other student in the school used charcoal or
graphite pencils.</p>
<p>“Pardon me for
the interruption,” Raz said, “but where did the word <i>elf</i> come from?”</p>
<p>Faenon caught
movement in the left corner of his eye. The blue-haired twin—evidently this one
was Yuli—held her hands near the elven light on her desk, not moving or
touching it, but the bolts on the base of the lamp were coming undone of their
own accord.</p>
<p>“In our language, we call
ourselves <i>isinni</i>,”
Raz continued in his loud and musical voice, “but when we came here, everyone
started calling us elves and I have no clue why and neither does anyone else
I’ve ever asked.”</p>
<p>The entire
class, the teacher included, was stunned
into silence by the question.
Faenon flicked his eyes to the left when the clink of glass was exposed in the
stillness. Panic filled Yuli’s eyes as she held the glass casing of the elven
light, suspended in the air with her magic, separate from the base.</p>
<p>“Wait, you don’t
know?” Faenon asked, frowning.</p>
<p>The teacher’s stance
shifted inward in the blink of an eye: a deferral of authority, and more
importantly to the twins, a high-stakes diversion. “I can’t say I’ve ever come
across that in my research,” he said, beginning to mumble.</p>
<p>“How the—<i>I </i>even
know this one,” Faenon said, swinging his legs up to the surface of his desk. “Elves
were originally a made-up race found in ancient fairy tales. The only
consistent description they were given across the literature is that they have
pointed ears and otherwise look like humans. Don’t know how it caught on, but
it’s obvious where it comes from.”</p>
<p>In his peripheral
vision, he saw more than a few impressed nods for his explanation of events. He
kept his eyes locked on the teacher to leave a lasting impression of the first
moment he took authority back away from the front of the classroom.</p>
<p>“That’s very
insightful information. Thank you, Faenon,” said the teacher while gripping the
edge of his desk and wearing what could only be called a smile. “Could I ask
where you got that information so that I can verify it when I return to the
University?”</p>
<p>Though he disguised
it as genuine interest, it was a clear grab for the power he had lost. He
stiffened his grammar and his vocabulary while delivering a reminder that he
was the University scholar in the room, not Faenon.</p>
<p>“No need to head back
to Gardena. We’ve got the books in our library,” Faenon replied, thumbing over
his shoulder despite having no frame of reference for where the library was.
“The new curator’s read all of them. You and she could have a good chat about
it.”</p>
<p>He glanced over at
the Itonami twins as he finished. Zuli was frantically reassembling the elven
light, and Yuli held a sliver of strange stone between her thumb and forefinger.
It was small, about the size of the part of the lamp’s inner stone that pulsed
with a hot glow as if wounded. Yuli smiled at Raz, who turned around in his
chair to pretend to listen to Faenon.</p>
<p>“Is there something
the matter with the light, ladies?” the teacher asked, frowning.</p>
<p>Yuli stuffed her hand
under her desk and sat up straight, shaking her head. Zuli whirled around,
having just tightened the final screw. “No, I just was trying to understand how
it works, Mr. Merlin,” said Zuli with a sweet smile that highlighted the plump,
pink apples of her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Well, that makes two
of us,” chuckled the teacher with an incredibly stupid name.
“It’s new technology beyond any of us.”</p>
<p>“Do you even know <i>anything</i>?”
Zuli muttered under her breath through her smile as she passed the lamp onward.</p>
<p>“So is this a good
time to ask any questions we have, sir?” Raz interjected, resting his pointed
chin on his thin, interlaced fingers. “Because I have a bit of a curriculum
question, as well. I think we all have the same question, but we’re all too shy
to ask about it. It’s a little touchy, you understand.”</p>
<p>Rune had
specifically told Faenon not to look at him every time something came up in
class that had to do with half-elves, but Faenon could not stop himself. Rune
sat just a little ways out of his line of sight, but the straight, red hair
that he had not cut in over a year veiled what would have been a blank face,
anyway. He defended himself by casting his face in stone, immutable and
emotionless no matter what Mr. Merlin said about half-elves. Though he posed as
Faenon’s brother, Rune was one of many children, but perhaps one of the few
still alive, at the darkest heart of human-elven
relations.</p>
<p>“So what’s the good
Gardenian dirt on the half-elf genocide?” Raz asked, beaming stupidly from ear
to pointed ear.</p>
<p>The sound was sucked
out of the room. A student froze in the midst of walking to the front desk to
return the elven light to the teacher, who would have been too stunned to
accept it in any case. Where Faenon liked to push buttons, Raz liked to deliver
a hearty slap to the face for the shock value.</p>
<p>“I think,” Mr. Merlin
began with a nervous laugh, “that you’re getting the wrong impression of what’s
going on in Gardena.”</p>
<p>“The impression we’re
getting is that half-elves are being abducted by the government and their
parents are being thrown in jail,” said Faenon. “You can maybe call that ‘not
genocide’ if the next thing you say is ‘yet’.”</p>
<p>Rune faced
forward with no shift in his expression or his posture, but the edge of
Faenon’s notebook was lighting with a small, green flame, so he knew that his
brother was angry at him. He smothered the fire with the callused part of his
palm at the base of his fingers.</p>
<p>“That’s…” Mr. Merlin
held his mouth open, but words failed to come out of it for too long. “I can
see how you might come away with that interpretation,” he said finally, folding
his arms. “The order of events is a little off. The law criminalizes the knowing
conception of a half-elf—it’s the fault of the parents, not the baby, after all—and
instead of just leaving the half-elf to die on its own, the government takes it
into custody.”</p>
<p>“It?” whispered Yuli
to her sister, making a face.</p>
<p>“So that’s really
what’s going on,” Mr. Merlin said. “The Gardenian government is doing all it
can to assist with the current crisis.”</p>
<p>“How is this a
crisis?” Faenon demanded. “Who decided it was a <i>crisis</i> that humans and
elves are getting married and having children? Why is that so wrong?”</p>
<p>“Listen, Faenon, I
understand where you’re coming from, I really do,” said Mr. Merlin with a
patronizing smile, “but it’s much more complicated than you’re making it sound.
It’s complicated biological science that you wouldn’t understand, but I can try
to simplify it for you after class if you’d like to hear about it.”</p>
<p>Faenon counted on his
fingers the grievances he had with what Mr. Merlin had just said, so that he
would remember them all as he made his rebuttal.</p>
<p>“So you don’t know
where the word ‘elf’ comes from, you don’t know how elven lights work, you
don’t sound like you really knew <i>why </i>the Celestial Event happened any
more than we already did,” Faenon said, “but it just so happens that you’re
some kind of science expert who’s all prepared to tell us why half-elves are
some kind of biological atrocity. Who sent you here and how much are they
paying you to spread the propaganda?”</p>
<p>Mr. Merlin’s face was
stony. “This was the subject of my thesis at—”</p>
<p>“Second of all, don’t
talk down to me,” Faenon continued in a louder voice. “Your job is to share
your knowledge, not to brag about how much smarter you are than us. If I have a
question, I deserve a decent answer. Third, don’t try to stop the conversation
that’s happening here. It’s a cold day in hell when I agree with Raz on
anything, but we <i>all </i>want to know what’s going on in Gardena, so you’re
going to tell us <i>right now </i>why your messed-up government hates
half-elves.”</p>
<p>Though reviled by his
teachers, Faenon won the admiration of his peers with his command of speech.
When he made his opinion known, it echoed through the student body. He felt the
support of his classmates backing his every word.</p>
<p>“The government does
not hate half-elves,” Mr. Merlin insisted, gripping both sides of his desk as
he loomed over it, red with rage and embarrassment. “I don’t want to
oversimplify things because it’s such a delicate issue with a lot of
complexities, but, if you’re forcing me to give you knowledge that you can
understand, it’s that half-elves are born with defects.”</p>
<p>When Faenon shot
back, “That’s
a load of bull,” he
nearly bit his tongue.
He did not notice he
had been standing until he fell back to his chair after realizing he had gone too far.</p>
<p>“No, that’s just the
result of ten years of research done on the half-elves abducted by the
government, as you put it,” said Mr. Merlin. “You come across as someone in the
habit of shouting your opinions loudly enough that you don’t have to hear the
facts proving you wrong. Is that true?”</p>
<p>Raz snapped his
fingers to send his compliments to the teacher, grinning viciously. Faenon
threw him a glare.</p>
<p>“Have you ever seen a
half-elf, Faenon?” Mr. Merlin asked.</p>
<p>“Have you?” he
responded to avoid admitting anything.</p>
<p>“I’ve studied several
in my time at the University. Seeing their defects firsthand was what inspired
me to pursue my research,” said Mr. Merlin. “The first known half-elf was born
missing an arm and had heart problems, according to some really extensive case
studies. The half-elf I studied in Meryville was blind and mute.”</p>
<p>The word “mute”
brought a grimace to Faenon’s face, and at the same time, Rune drew his arms
closer to his body.</p>
<p>“In our studies we
discovered that it also could not comprehend any spoken language we tried to
teach it,” continued Mr. Merlin. “You’re envisioning innocent children, Faenon,
and they are innocent children, but they aren’t like us. It’s tragic to see one
in person.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to stop
calling that kid ‘it’ right now,” Faenon growled, squeezing his eyes shut. “How
do you know it’s because they’re half-elves? People are born blind and mute
and sick and missing limbs all the time.” His eyes shot up when he remembered
the name for the fallacy he was describing. “Confirmation bias. You’re actively
looking for reasons to prove your side right. It’s called confirmation bias.”</p>
<p>He had a
rudimentary understanding of logical fallacies and cognitive biases, having
learned many by name from conversations with his father. They still seemed to
him a list of magical phrases that his father could say to render Faenon’s
argument automatically invalid.</p>
<p>“Thanks for your concern, but we
have advanced mathematics to prove it’s not a bias,” Mr. Merlin said. “There’s
a higher
incidence of certain
defects in half-elven populations. The current theory is it’s the biological
incompatibility between humans and elves.”</p>
<p>Faenon lost his
patience.</p>
<p>“<i>What </i>biological incompatibility? Who told you there was a
biological incompatibility? The government?!”
he shouted. “You wanna talk biology? Althea Rider says if you cut the ears off
a guy and told her to heal him, she couldn’t tell you if he was a human or an
elf. That’s how similar they are.”</p>
<p>Mr. Merlin’s nose wrinkled in disgust. “Now, listen, I’ve heard about Miss Rider, but she’s certainly not an authority on
these—”</p>
<p>“Althea Rider
is the only authority!” Faenon yelled as he slammed his hands on his desk and
shot to his feet, boiling with fury. “Althea Rider is the first healer this
world has seen in literally thousands of years! If you’re not going to listen
to someone who can actually commune with people’s bodies—”</p>
<p>“I listen to
facts, Faenon,” Mr.
Merlin
stated. “We’ve poured out study after
scientific study proving there’s
something wrong. Half-elves are prone to certain psychotic disorders, to birth
defects, as I already—”</p>
<p>“Psychotic?
Like mental stuff?” Faenon said. “So a whole bunch of kids you lock up in some
secret facility away from the rest of society go insane? What a stunning
revelation. Never would have guessed.”</p>
<p>“Alright, that’s not at all what’s
happening,”
said Mr. Merlin, “but even if it were, I would love to hear an
explanation for how isolation causes
gender
disorders.”</p>
<p>For a moment,
Faenon was very far away from their conversation. His body became numb. “Gender
disorders,” he finally repeated.</p>
<p>“I warned you this would get
complicated,” Mr. Merlin sighed. “It’s
a psychotic disorder in which a person experiences delusions that cause them to
believe they’re a member of the opposite sex. It
tends to appear in adolescence,
which is how old our half-elf sample has gotten. We’ve never seen this many cases of these disorders in all of
Meryville, and we’re
only working with about a dozen half-elves.”</p>
<p>Faenon had begun
counting points of contention on his fingers, but he went past five, and he did not have
permission to speak
about any of them, so they
combined into a hot rage in his arms and his face. He shuddered with a burst of
hateful energy and shoved his desk to the floor, where it clattered loudly,
startling the classmates who were not watching him and intriguing those who
were. He picked up his notebook, tearing a leaf that was caught under the desk,
and made for the door. Rune held his hands clasped together and rested his
forehead on his fingers, concealing his face with his long, red hair.</p>
<p>“Is there a problem?”
asked Mr. Merlin with his oily grin. “I know it’s hard to hear the truth when
you’ve denied it for so long, but you don’t have to leave.”</p>
<p>Faenon hated losing,
and he knew that to leave now was an apparent loss, but Rune was begging him
with white knuckles to leave it be. “I’m leaving so you can keep your teeth,” he
seethed as he walked out the door. “I don’t know where to even begin with you.”</p>
<p>It was coming on
fourteen years to the day since Althea
Rider discovered her magic by healing the wounds of an elven boy who had fallen through a tear in
the sky during the chaos of the Celestial Event. Despite how often she had
talked of going to Meryville to study, or traveling across the continent to
help those in need with her talents, or doing anything she possibly could to
leave Azier and its people behind as soon as she became an adult, Althea had
not even left school after graduating. She stayed to preside over the only
facility within the school that she could still tolerate, and the one that
Faenon still struggled to find after fourteen years: the library.</p>
<p>The cavernous
room was dimly lit and smelled of mildew, and the books lined the shelves with
reckless abandon. A couple of shelves had had their contents removed and placed
in stacks on the ground, but it was a task abandoned. At the main desk sat a
young woman lost in a book. Since her early teens, she had taken to wearing a
scarf around her neck, even in warm weather, to hide a thick neck and mask her
broad shoulders. Her collected composure broke with a pronounced slouch,
however, when she saw Faenon
peer in the door.</p>
<p>“Can I help
you find something?” she asked. Her voice had depth and power, especially when
it dripped with sarcasm.
“Maybe your classroom? Your sense of respect?”</p>
<p>“Patience, maybe,”
Faenon muttered.</p>
<p>“Tragic. So you lost
the first argument of the school year,” Althea sighed, picking up her book. Before
he could launch into an excuse, she snapped, “Suck it up and go back to class.
I’m not going to be your stand-in punching bag.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going back
to class. It’s worthless,” Faenon said. “If you’re really going to go study in Meryville
someday, promise you won’t come back and tell people there’s not a genocide.”</p>
<p>Althea put
her book down on the desk, staring at it where it lay between her hands. “The Human-Elven Relations teacher?” she murmured. “They taught him to lie to you?”</p>
<p>“Could be. He sounds more rehearsed than the
school choir.”</p>
<p>“The choir is
terrible.”</p>
<p>“It was a
multi-faceted joke.”</p>
<p>Althea looked
as if about to respond, but her eyes flashed. “Don’t start a fight in here,” she said.</p>
<p>“Why would I—?” Faenon began to ask
just as the reason walked into the library with one slender hand in his pink hair and the
other in the pocket of his patchwork jacket.</p>
<p>Althea’s
talent for healing came with the usual perks that mages enjoyed: their awareness
of all magical energy, including auras. She never found her sixth sense of much
use; she once told Faenon that her perception was about as accurate and
constrained as her eyesight. She saw Raz approach in her mind’s eye before
Faenon saw him with his own eyes
only because of the door that stood between them.</p>
<p>Althea slid her feet apart to
strengthen her large stance.
She was
still wearing her mother’s army boots, which she had worn every day since they
first fit on her feet. She had never had a problem with flowing skirts,
embroidered fabrics, and long hair, unlike many of the rougher girls of Azier,
but she would wear nothing else but those army boots for shoes. To her, they
represented a power that was strictly feminine.</p>
<p>Raz’s grin
was wide, but false, as usual. “Well, I certainly didn’t expect to see you in
here, Faenon,” he said cheerfully.</p>
<p>“What, did you walk out, too?” Faenon asked. “See, Althea, I’m telling you, it’s not me,
it’s the class.”</p>
<p>Raz raised
his pink eyebrows. “I thought the class was a wonderful step in the right
direction,” he responded innocently. “I
was only stopping by on my way to choir rehearsal.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t the choir
rehearsal start an hour ago?” Faenon asked, because that was when Kari had
gathered her things and departed with an unnecessary apology.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you get
kicked out of the choir?” Althea added, narrowing her eyes.</p>
<p>“In a manner
of speaking,” he said, shifting his weight from one leg to the other.</p>
<p>“Why did—how do you
even get…?” Faenon trailed off; he decided that he did not want to know the
answer.</p>
<p>Raz spoke as
if not having heard him. “But, you see, in a shocking and honestly
incomprehensible turn of events, it turns out I can still be Bryn’s personal
copyist by way of detention as long as he’s not supervising me,” he continued, resting an elbow on Althea’s
desk and jutting out one angular hip. “He said he dropped some music off here earlier
today. I’ll take it off your hands.”</p>
<p>Althea
narrowed her eyes. “Whose personal copyist?”</p>
<p>“Bryn,
Bryniar. You know, the music teacher. Mr. K,” Raz responded.</p>
<p>“I was afraid
of that,” she muttered, spreading out the papers on her desk to find the stack
with musical notation. “Am I supposed to just enable this?”</p>
<p>Raz held his
chin in his hands and fluttered his eyelashes. “You’re a real teacher now,
dearie,” he sighed. “A cog in the wheel of bureaucracy.”</p>
<p>She slapped
Raz in the face with the music just before releasing the sheets so that they
scattered and fell to the floor before his eyes. Raz showed the inkling of his
first real emotion—panic—as
he scrambled to gather and order the pages. Althea was ready with a ream of
clean paper when Raz rose and hit him over the head with that, as well. He soon
stationed himself at a table with his bottle of ink and feather quill to make
what were probably the most impeccable copies ever conceived.</p>
<p>The clock
chimed twice. Althea glanced at it, then at Faenon. “Shouldn’t you be going to
practice?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t
Raz be going to practice?” he muttered.</p>
<p>Raz had never
attended a weapons class in all of his time in Azier. His twin cousins
practiced magic in the outside field along with the few other mages in the
town, including Rune. Raz said he had no such talent, but never pursued any
other talents during the daily practice hours.</p>
<p>“I’m not pursuing
a lost cause,” she said. “What’s with you? I thought this was the only reason
you came to school anymore.”</p>
<p>“If your
dad’s not teaching me, I’m not going,” Faenon stated, crossing his arms.</p>
<p>“He’s too old
and he’s a bag full of crap, anyway,” Althea retorted. “Go swing your dumb axe
around. Whoever’s teaching you now probably isn’t horrible.”</p>
<p>“I don’t
care. Deric made it fun,” Faenon whined.</p>
<p>The hint of
disgust in her expression faded when she turned towards the door to the
library. “Your brother’s here,” she said. “Faenon, what in the world did you do?”</p>
<p>She could not
finish her sentence before Faenon vaulted behind the desk. He recognized the
squeak in the sound
of his
brother’s steps, for he had been the one to wear the soles to their weakened
state before Rune received his hand-me-downs.</p>
<p>Althea stared
down at Faenon. “You do realize that, not only can he sense your aura from
across the school, but he also saw you jump over my desk,” she said. “Get up.”</p>
<p>With no great
haste, Faenon rose from his imperfect hiding spot, avoiding Rune’s eyes. Angry,
green flames flared in front of his face and sent him staggering backwards,
gripping the edge of the desk behind him to stay on his feet. They thinned and
spelled a message: <i>DO NOT</i>.</p>
<p>Althea’s
eyebrows shot up as the flames vanished into thin air as quickly as they had
appeared. “That’s a new trick,” she mumbled.</p>
<p>If Faenon had
a silver coin for every time his brother tried a new trick on him, he would
have left Azier some time ago to live in a castle. Furious shudders ran through
Rune’s face and his small, skinny body, but his lips did not part. He slammed
his hand on Faenon’s notebook to slide it closer and used the pencil to write a
message. He shifted it forcefully towards Faenon, who deciphered his microscopic
handwriting to read, <i>Don’t talk in that class again.</i></p>
<p>“I’m trying
to talk about your cause,” Faenon whispered, glancing at Raz to ensure that he
was still absorbed in the delight of facsimile. “Sorry for defending your
rights.”</p>
<p>Rune wrenched
the notebook out of Faenon’s hands and scribbled furiously, <i>Don’t need
rights. Need to stay alive.</i> When he was sure Faenon had read the message,
he wrote something more and passed the notebook to Althea.</p>
<p>She read it
and frowned, then glared at Faenon. “You ratted me out?” she said, fingers
curling around the edge of the paper. “What the hell did you say in that
class?”</p>
<p>Faenon could
not remember doing any such thing and thought he had defended her more than
anything, but Rune motioned for the notebook to explain. <i>Implied you are
pro-half-elf,</i> he wrote, <i>from biological perspective</i>.</p>
<p>“He thinks
half-elves are born with defects!” Faenon hissed in a poor attempt to keep Raz
from hearing their conversation.</p>
<p><i>Maybe we
are,</i>
wrote Rune, and then he pushed both paper and pencil forward in a flash of rage
before he turned on his heel and stormed to the door.</p>
<p>“Perfect
timing,” Althea muttered to Faenon, a second before Kari Rider pushed open the
library door with what little weight she had.</p>
<p>When she saw
Rune, her round, blue eyes grew wider and she froze. She raised her small hands
and opened her mouth to say something as he came closer. Without sparing her a
glance, Rune shoved her out of his way and made his exit.</p>
<p>“Rune!”
Faenon shouted, vaulting over the desk. “Get back here, you little—”</p>
<p>“No, don’t,
it’s okay,” Kari said as she stumbled back to her feet and stared at the
ground.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not
okay, and don’t you dare tell him it is when he says he’s sorry,” Faenon
snapped. “You can accept his apology, but don’t let him think for a second that
this is any way to treat his friends, especially not you.”</p>
<p>Kari was a
small girl for her age, especially among the bulky builds of Azierites, and her
age was the youngest of the group at just ten years. Though Faenon had seen her
in her arching gear on many occasions before, she looked strange in a library
wearing leather arm guards, a quiver full of arrows around her waist, and the
daunting frame of her bow hanging off of her shoulder. Every word, every
action, every gesture she made was in deference, which was why she could say
she didn’t mind living with her cousin, as difficult as Althea could be.</p>
<p>Raz abandoned
his copying to attend to Kari. “Are you alright, little lady?” he asked as he
slid her bow to a more secure spot on her shoulder.</p>
<p>A healthy
pink color returned to Kari’s cheeks as she smiled up at him. “Hi, Raz,” she
chirped.</p>
<p>In the short
year that Raz had spent in Azier with his cousins, he had grown quite close to
Kari, much to Faenon’s distaste. If it had been anyone but Kari who had made
such an unscrupulous friend, Faenon would have long since fallen onto worse
terms with Raz. It would break Kari’s pure heart to see her two friends at odds
with each other, so Faenon, with great effort, held his tongue.</p>
<p>Kari’s gaze
soon turned to Althea, whose arms were folded and whose stare was intense.
“Someone’s hurt already,” Althea said.</p>
<p>The color in
Kari’s face faded as quickly as it had appeared. She reached behind her head
and grabbed the long ponytail of tangled, caramel-colored hair at her neck as
she mumbled, “Well, we have a new archer this year, and…”</p>
<p>With her
skirt and her hair billowing out behind her, Althea moved like a storm out from
behind her desk and towards the door. “Outside shooting range or room 7?” she
demanded.</p>
<p>“Room 7,”
Kari called, clasping her hands together under her chin and standing on her
toes as her cousin exited. Raz placed his hands on her shoulders and leaned
over her until she let her shoulders fall back to their natural position. She
stared at her interlaced fingers and loosened them from each other, letting her
hands hang by her side. Her big, blue eyes turned to Faenon, and she asked, “Is
Rune okay?”</p>
<p>“He’s just
mad,” Faenon said with a shrug. “It got worse over the summer. Eighty pounds of
pure teenage angst, and he’s only twelve.”</p>
<p>“He seemed…”
Kari trailed off, chewing on the index finger of her leather gauntlet. “I’m not
sure. He’s never been like that. He wasn’t mad, it was… panic.”</p>
<p>“The class
you missed for choir was probably really rough on him,” Raz said in a low
voice.</p>
<p>Every muscle
in Faenon’s body went rigid. “What makes you think that?” he asked with a dry
throat.</p>
<p>Kari’s
shoulders shot back up to her ears. “Um, Raz knows,” she squeaked.</p>
<p>Raz gave him
a wink that made him feel queasy, but another thought made him queasier. “Does
Rune know that you know?” he asked.</p>
<p>Kari nodded,
wringing her hands.</p>
<p>“And he still
wrote out his entire conversation with me and Althea,” Faenon said. “It wasn’t
because he didn’t want anyone to hear.”</p>
<p>Raz cringed
with a slight hint of a smile, as one does when secretly enjoying the sight of
another person in pain. Only sickening guilt kept Faenon from causing his
skinnier peer bodily harm. He grabbed his own hair at the roots, closed his
eyes, and exhaled a swear on hot, anxious air.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,
it probably wasn’t all your fault,” Raz said, covering Kari’s virgin ears with
his hands. “Having his existence invalidated by an authority figure probably
scared him more than anything you could’ve said.”</p>
<p>Faenon
frowned. “Just how much do you know about Rune?” he asked, but he got his
answer from Kari’s twitching lips, widening eyes, and flaming-red face.</p>
<p>Raz laughed
as he strolled back to the table where he had left his copies. “You’ll keep
fighting that sap while I’m gone, won’t you?” he said as he lifted his papers
with a grand flourish of his arm. “For me and my girls.”</p>
<p>“While you’re
gone?” Kari said in a small voice.</p>
<p>“Yep. So
sorry for the short notice, little lady, but we’re leaving town tonight,”
replied Raz, tapping his stack of paper into alignment against the table. “Me
and Zuli and Yuli. We’re gonna go live in a treehouse.”</p>
<p>“A
treehouse?” repeated Faenon.</p>
<p>“Is that why
you wouldn’t accept a job as a copyist?” Kari asked.</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t
accept it because I value my education,” Raz said with his nose in the air.</p>
<p>“You walked
out of class five minutes after I did and you’ve never gone to a practice
session in the whole year you’ve been here,” Faenon said. “If you value your
education, then I’m a model student.”</p>
<p>“My
educational priorities just aren’t in line with the standard Azierite
curriculum,” Raz sniffed. “I don’t like fighting. I practice my magic in the
choir.”</p>
<p> “If that
isn’t the corniest thing I’ve ever heard,” Faenon muttered.</p>
<p>“You’d better
get back to practice, little lady,” Raz said to Kari, nudging her forward from
behind. “They’re already wondering why Althea got there before you did, and you
can only say you were lecturing two truants about the importance of attending
class for so long.”</p>
<p>The blood
drained from her face and she darted out of the library, while Raz laughed and
followed her at a leisurely pace, carrying the copies. Before he shut the door
behind him, he peered back at Faenon with earnest eyes and a furrowed brow.</p>
<p>“Tell your
brother to stop going to that class,” he said. “The less he hears about the
genocide, the better. You stay and fight that bastard on every piece of garbage
that comes out of his mouth. You’re better at it than I am, anyway. Please.”</p>
<p>Faenon
cracked an odd smile to find a moment of kinship with one of his least favorite
Azierites. “Sure thing,” he replied. “I’m
pretty sure Althea
runs detention now that she’s librarian, anyway.”</p>
<p>Raz flashed a
wide grin. “You’re an <i>excellent</i> human, you know that?!” he called before
disappearing into the hallway.</p>
<p>Left alone in
the library, Faenon glanced at the way the books lined the shelves in disarray.
He had no idea how Althea wanted things sorted, but he could at least take them
off of their shelves and begin to stack them in alphabetical order by author. </p>
<p>When Althea
returned, she asked, “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Getting a
head start on the detention
I assume I’m getting,”
Faenon responded, pulling the heftiest of tomes from the shelves, though they
offered no resistance to his hold. “Your dad promised he’d fight today and I
don’t want to be stuck at school for that.”</p>
<p>“Deric is a
liar.” Whenever she could help it, she called him by his first name.</p>
<p>“He
promised,” said Faenon, before he could stop himself.</p>
<p>Althea
retreated to behind her desk and picked up her book again, scowling. “He
wouldn’t lie to you, would he,” she muttered. “Must be nice.”</p>
<p>Faenon
continued to take books off of the shelves. He had heard Althea and Deric argue
about lies on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>School ended
after practice. A full primary education in Azier lasted fifteen years because
the school days were so short; students spent many more hours working and
helping their families than learning. Usually Althea and Faenon did not walk
home together, since Faenon lived just outside the village gates and Althea was
well within them, but they did on practice days, because the farm that Faenon’s
father tended had an abandoned pasture outside of a lifeless barn. It had once
been inhabited, even as recently as Faenon’s earlier memories, but when he remembered
animals, he remembered his mother. He had been too young to remember the
circumstances of the animals’ disappearance, but he later reasoned that his
father had sold the livestock so that he had the time to raise two motherless
sons. The fenced-in pasture now served as a battlefield, and the barn was where
Faenon hung his axe.</p>
<p>Between the
rows of vegetation, Corona Winter stood strong under the pressure of the sun. An
autumn chill had already returned to the air, preparing for the Northern
Plains’ long winter, but the heat of the summer still reigned every afternoon.
Corona removed his gardening gloves, wiped the sweat from his hands on his
well-worn trousers, and ran his sleeve across his forehead. As he rested, his
and Faenon’s eyes met, and they nodded at each other from a distance. His
father, like his brother, liked to have time to himself, and the field was
their place of solitude. Kari did not trespass into the rows of crops; she
waited at the field’s edge for Rune. With his magic, Rune carried water from
the rain barrel and gently fed the soil. When he left the sanctuary of the
garden, his lips moved for Kari.</p>
<p>Althea did
not talk to her father, either, but for her own reasons. Deric was a
fair-haired man with silver spreading from his temples. Having come from a
smithing family, he learned to wield a sword at a young age but, like Faenon,
found he preferred the axe. He crossed paths with Moriel during his time in the
Northern Army when they countered the Gardenian invasion. The two settled down
in her hometown where they bought the forge of an aging blacksmith.</p>
<p>Moriel, whom
Althea most resembled, was a thoroughbred Azierite, meaning she was noticeably
larger than her husband. She was skilled at using all types of swords and gave
Deric expert advice on their design. When demand was high, she taught her
skills to the most advanced swordsmen in the school. It was common practice for
the older students to convince the younger ones to take up the sword in order
to force Moriel to teach a class. Deric, once the primary teacher for the axe,
grew older as Faenon grew stronger under his tutelage, and the previous school
year had been his last.</p>
<p>Ever since
Faenon received his first dummy axe, made of wood with a dulled edge, the two
families had come together to battle in the pasture. The practice benefited
both Faenon, who had zeal for this civilized violence from a young age, and
Althea, who could only learn to heal from a steady stream of injuries. The
wounds became more serious and more complicated as she became more skilled, as
Faenon learned to wield a true axe, as Rune began to learn magic, as Kari
joined in with her bow and arrows, and as the battles became less like play and
more like reality.</p>
<p>Althea sat by
the barn door and Corona stood over her. Faenon, Rune, and Kari faced Deric and
Moriel in the golden grass. They arranged themselves not for one battle but two
separate ones; Deric was Faenon’s opponent alone. Deric recognized every
mistake that Faenon made and could take advantage of each one. His criticism
was unforgiving, but he usually coupled it with kind laughter as he helped
Faenon to Althea’s side. He was typically a good-natured, cheerful man, but
Faenon knew from a glance that today he would not be so kind.</p>
<p>Deric’s
expression was not unfamiliar, but when such fatigue lined his face, his dark
eyes usually sought out Althea from time to time, so that Faenon could take
advantage of his distractedness to triumph. Today, Deric stared him down,
unblinking, and his axe was brutal. Faenon fell to his knees before the aging
man more times than he could count on his blistering fingers, and Deric had no
smile or word of advice. Once, he murmured, “You’ve got to get better than
this.”</p>
<p>Corona disappeared
into the house during the fight, and when it stopped not at Althea’s call of
exhaustion, but Faenon’s, a simple but plentiful dinner was ready, filling the
house with the hearty aroma of vegetables that had come into season. Instead of
discussing Faenon’s performance in the battle, Deric remained withdrawn,
twirling a spoon on the bottom of his bowl of soup as if this activity was more
interesting than the conversations of the two families.</p>
<p>The Riders did not
linger after dinner. As Faenon scrubbed dishes clean for his brother to rinse
and dry, Corona tapped his shoulder and said, “Althea tells me you’ve already
made a good impression on one of your teachers.”</p>
<p>Faenon slammed a
stone bowl to the countertop and rolled his eyes. “He was being a snob,” he
protested. “A racist, Gardenian snob.”</p>
<p>“Gardenians are
people, too, Faenon,” Corona chided gently. In a village full of
simple-minded men easily incensed to rash
action, he valued reflection and empathy. </p>
<p>“He was going on and
on about how half-elves are these tragic creatures born with defects,” Faenon
complained, ignoring his brother as he set down dishes with shaking hands and
left the room without a word. “And then he just kept talking down to me and
telling me it was stuff I wouldn’t understand when he didn’t even try to
explain it. He had absolutely zero respect for me.”</p>
<p>“Of course he had no
respect for you, Faenon,” Corona said, watching Rune’s bedroom door close. “Did
you give him a reason to respect you?”</p>
<p>Faenon opened his
mouth to say something, but felt his cheeks flush when he found no words.</p>
<p>“You always complain
about not being respected by adults, but you forget that you will have to <i>earn</i>
your elders’ respect,” Corona said. “You should consider that an advantage,
that they expect nothing from you and you can impress them to earn their
respect. It is a far worse thing to be afforded respect as a courtesy and have
it revoked when you don’t meet expectations. See to it that you keep both of
these lessons in mind.”</p>
<p>Faenon’s blood
boiled, but he was in the habit of keeping lessons from his father in his mind.
“I’m angry because I know you’re right, and I don’t want to talk about it right
now,” he said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“That’s fair. Thank
you, Faenon,” said Corona with a smile. “Can we still talk if I change the
subject?”</p>
<p>“Depends.”</p>
<p>“How is Rune?”</p>
<p>Faenon sighed and
leaned on the counter under the renewed weight on his shoulders. “He’s
brilliant. He needs to go to University someday. You know he does,” he said. “But
it’s getting worse at school.”</p>
<p>“And Kari wasn’t able
to help?” said Corona.</p>
<p>“No, now he’s lashing
out at her, too,” Faenon muttered. “Not just me anymore.”</p>
<p>Corona rested a heavy
hand on Faenon’s back. “Some days I wonder what I did to deserve such a
troublesome son,” he confessed, “and then there are days like today, when I
wonder what I did to deserve the perfect one.”</p>
<p>Faenon shivered. “Hey,
give me some warning before you say weird stuff like that,” he mumbled.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” said Corona.
“I just know we’ll be parting ways soon.”</p>
<p>Through years
of chopping firewood and hunting in the outskirts of the forest that bled into
the vacant territory of Lucusia, Faenon had earned petty change
that he collected in
a box under his dresser.
He had first hidden the box to keep it
from his father,
back when he
was afraid to say that he did not want to stay on the farm. Hiding the box
could not hide the dream; Corona saw the desire to leave Azier in his son’s
eyes. Before Faenon could confess, Corona told the story of his two brothers,
who left Azier as young men. He called Azier a toxic place. He explained that
he would never want to hurt his children by chaining them to a place in which
they could not live, but just the same, he would never want to hurt his
children by not teaching them everything they could possibly know before he let
them go. So Corona agreed to support Faenon in any choice he made on the
condition that he completed his education. Faenon kept the box under his
dresser in case he could not wait that long.</p>

<p>When Faenon
thought it was strange that my earliest memory was of a dream, I confessed for
the first time in my life that I had had a premonition. I was far too young to
realize what had happened, let alone to make sense of it and tell anyone what I
had seen. It was a dream deprived of sensation, but so thick with information
that there must be pieces I have forgotten. I never had another dream like it,
so I stopped talking about it as the years went on, but I could not keep from
thinking about it.</p>
<p>It took place in
a vast nothingness. When I looked around, it seemed black, but even the color
black is too much of a presence to be the word to describe that empty world. I
saw my hands before my eyes and my feet below them, bright and pink as ever,
but that was all, until there was a stranger standing with me.</p>
<p>Time distorts
her features, but I remember the stiff bend of her gaunt, pale body as she
stooped to my level, the way she stretched her great wings as she listened to
me speak, and the long, white-blonde hair that was caught in her dark feathers.
I might have recognized then that she was a demon from drawings of the winged
beasts, though I denied it for a long time. Demons were evil, and she was not.</p>
<p>“I need to tell
you something very important,” the woman said. “I can show you something that
will seal your fate. I want you to make a big decision, Althea.”</p>
<p>I often think
that she sealed my fate with that introduction. Although I grew nervous as she
spoke each weighty word, I fell under her spell as soon as she called me by
name.</p>
<p>“When someone
gets hurt, how do you feel?” she asked.</p>
<p>I am sure that I
had a limited understanding of my own emotions at the time, or at least of how
to express them, but I remember thinking long and hard about this question. My
culture invited pain, even embraced it. The boys in my class were just getting
to the age where they wanted to squabble amongst each other as a test of
strength, emulating their warrior fathers.</p>
<p>“I don’t like
it,” I mumbled.</p>
<p>“Can you tell me
more?”</p>
<p>I tried to be
like the girls, who preferred a loving camaraderie with one another. Despite my
efforts, or perhaps because of them, the boys singled me out as a frequent
target. I needed to hurt others in order to not get hurt myself, but I hated
the way children’s faces broke in pain when I caused them harm.</p>
<p>“I wish nobody
had to fight,” I said, “but we have to fight, that’s how it is.”</p>
<p>War started with
childhood squabbles and grew into organized battles with weapons and armor
against other warriors from distant lands. When I saw the injury that was part
of that lifestyle, I had this urge inside me to take those wounds and make them
disappear, smoothing the skin over as if it were clay, and I a sculptor of the
human body.</p>
<p>“I wish I knew
how to fix it when people get hurt so it wouldn’t be so bad when we fight,” I
said.</p>
<p>The woman smiled
wryly at me. “This choice isn’t in my hands at all, is it?” she said to
herself. “Let me show you something.”</p>
<p>I watched in
horror as she lifted a knife and swept it across her arm, drawing a thin, red line
of blood that slowly oozed out from under her skin. She tried to hold the wound
closer to me so that I could see it, but I recoiled, so she held her position.</p>
<p>Her opposite
hand hovered over her cut and began to glow with a sea-green light. I couldn’t take
my eyes off of that light until it faded back away, but when I searched for the
blemish that the woman had inflicted upon herself, I found no trace of it.</p>
<p>“It’s still up
to you to decide whether you want to follow this path, but I think I know what
you’ll choose, Althea,” she said. “Now, if everything here is working as I
believe it is, you’re about to witness the Celestial Event, so you would do
well to wake up from this dream you’re having.”</p>

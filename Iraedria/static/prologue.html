            <h2>Prologue</h2>
            <p>
   <span class="drop-cap">W</span>hen I was four years old, I fell asleep at school and had a premonition. I was far too young to realize what had happened—it was years before it dawned on
    me—let alone to make sense of it and tell anyone what I had seen. It was a dream deprived of sensation, but so thick with information that there must be
    pieces I have forgotten. I never had another dream like it, so I stopped talking about it as the years went on, but I could not keep from thinking about
    it.
</p>
<p>
    It took place in a vast nothingness. When I looked around, it seemed black, but even the color black is too much of a presence to be the word to describe
    that empty world. I saw my hands before my eyes and my feet below them, bright and pink as ever, but that was all, until there was a stranger standing with
    me.
</p>
<p>
    Time distorts her features, but I remember the stiff bend of her gaunt, pale body as she stooped to my level, the way she stretched her great wings as she
    listened to me speak, and the long, white-blonde hair that was caught in her black feathers. I might have recognized then that she was a demon from
    drawings of the winged beasts, though I denied it for a long time. Demons were evil, and she was not.
</p>
<p>
    “I need to tell you something very important,” the woman said. “I can show you something that will seal your fate. I want you to make a big decision,
    Althea.”
</p>
<p>
    I often think that she sealed my fate with that introduction. Although I grew nervous as she spoke each weighty word, I fell under her spell as soon as she
    called me by name.
</p>
<p>
    “When someone gets hurt, how do you feel?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
    I am sure that I had a limited understanding of my own emotions at the time, or at least of how to express them, but I remember thinking long and hard
    about this question. My culture invited pain, even embraced it. The boys in my class were just getting to the age where they wanted to squabble amongst
    each other as a test of strength, emulating their warrior fathers.
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t like it,” I mumbled.
</p>
<p>
    “Can you tell me more?”
</p>
<p>
    I tried to be like the girls, who preferred a loving camaraderie with one another. Despite my efforts, or perhaps because of them, the boys singled me out
    as a frequent target. I needed to hurt others in order to not get hurt myself, but I hated the way children’s faces broke in pain when I caused them harm.
</p>
<p>
    “I wish nobody had to fight,” I said, “but we have to fight, that’s how it is.”
</p>
<p>
    War started with childhood squabbles and grew into organized battles with weapons and armor against other warriors from distant lands. When I saw the
    injury that was part of that lifestyle, I had this urge inside me to take those wounds and make them disappear, smoothing the skin over as if it were clay,
    and I a sculptor of the human body.
</p>
<p>
    “I wish I knew how to fix it when people get hurt so it wouldn’t be so bad when we fight,” I said.
</p>
<p>
    The woman smiled wryly at me. “This choice isn’t in my hands at all, is it?” she said to herself. “Let me show you something.”
</p>
<p>
    I watched in horror as she lifted a knife and swept it across her arm, drawing a thin, red line of blood that slowly oozed out from under her skin. She
    tried to hold the wound closer to me so that I could see it, but I recoiled, so she held her position.
</p>
<p>
    Her opposite hand hovered over her cut and began to glow with a sea-green light. I couldn’t take my eyes off of that light until it faded back away, but
    when I searched for the blemish that the woman had inflicted upon herself, I found no trace of it.
</p>
<p>
    “It’s still up to you to decide whether you want to follow this path, but I think I know what you’ll choose, Althea,” she said. “Now, if everything here is
    working as I believe it is, you’re about to witness the Celestial Event, so you would do well to wake up from this dream you’re having.”

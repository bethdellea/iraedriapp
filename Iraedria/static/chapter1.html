    <span class="drop-cap">I</span>n an enlightened world, the typical young person's life is divided primarily into time at school and time away from school. When he has too much of the
    former, he craves the latter, but when he has the latter in excess, he, albeit reluctantly, begins to desire the former. Faenon never understood this
    sentiment; he had always dreaded returning to school, no matter how long the vacation. His father said it was because he had activities other than his
    schooling to keep him busy, particularly helping with the farm or, as the old man called it, swinging his axe around like a madman and passing it off as
    practice. Faenon often asked to drop out of school, as a good fraction of his classmates already had, classmates who followed their parents into trades or
    who had completed their required number of years of education required by the Northern Army. His father responded by saying that Faenon was a simple child,
    and Faenon, being seventeen years old, liked neither of those words. He said that when Faenon was no longer a simple child, he could leave school, and
    unless he finished his schooling, he would always be a simple child. This trapped Faenon in quite a predicament, but, luckily, he had finally come upon the
    first day of his last year.
</p>
<p>
    While most of his classes, such as math and writing, were sequential and therefore inevitable, Faenon did have a choice in what topic of history he wanted
    to learn. This year he had chosen a newly offered class that he presumed would be easy, considering he had lived through the entire duration of the subject
    matter. Most of his classmates were either too young to remember what had happened almost fourteen years ago, or had been born after that pivotal moment in
    history.
</p>
<p>
    "Welcome to Human-Elven Relations," said the young teacher when the clock reached precisely one o'clock. "My name is Miss Chestnut. I'd like to begin the
    class by telling you my background on the subject we'll be discussing this semester."
</p>
<p>
    Faenon had never heard of or seen Miss Chestnut, and when she said she had just begun studying at university at the time of the Celestial Event, he deduced
    her age to be between thirty and thirty-five. Her words were precise as if rehearsed to memorization, and her impeccably neat appearance suggested that she
    was the type to commit such a speech to memory. Although she admitted that she studied in Meryville, Faenon noticed that she refrained from mentioning
    Gardena, the region of which Meryville was the capital. Gardena was a loaded word in the Northern Plains, particularly in Azier. It had been only two
    decades since Gardena attempted to invade and govern the Northern Plains, against which the proud, independent Azierites and other neighboring towns
    revolted, eventually forcing the Gardenians back to the east.
</p>
<p>
    Meryville was, according to Miss Chestnut, home to a large populations of elves and therefore an important social battleground, so she stayed in Meryville
    after her official studies so that she could observe the relationship between elves and humans. She did assure the class of her Azierite heritage, although
    it was an unnecessary statement, because had she not been from Azier, she would not be in Azier now. Its reputation as a home to warriors, veterans, and
    children learning to fight in the public school, drove away most outsiders, and the three guards posted around the village prevented almost anyone,
    especially someone from Gardena, from entering its stone walls. There were few elves in Azier, and this was why Miss Chestnut thought that her class was so
    important to teach.
</p>
<p>
    "We will have many classroom discussions on controversial topics, such as elven representation in government, the difficulties of the language barrier, and
    interracial issues," Miss Chestnut said, swallowing after she finished her statement. Faenon searched her eyes for her opinion on the last item on her
    list, for it was the sole interest he had in her class.
</p>
            <p>
    Rune had specifically told Faenon not to look at him every time something came up in class that had to do with half-elves, but he couldn't help himself.
    Rune sat just a little ways out of his line of sight, but the straight, red hair that he had not cut in over a year veiled what would have been a blank
    face, anyway. He defended himself by casting his face in stone, immutable and emotionless no matter what Miss Chestnut said about half-elves. Though he
    posed as Faenon's brother, Rune was one of many children, but perhaps one of the few still alive, at the darkest heart of the human-elven relations.
</p>
<p>
    "I'll answer any questions you have now, about the curriculum or about my experience in Meryville," Miss Chestnut concluded, "and then we will begin with
    our first lesson. Questions?"
</p>
<p>
    A hand went up next to Faenon that belonged to one of the few elves in Azier. There were three that he knew, all named Itonami, and they hung out almost
    exclusively with each other. They had wrestled their way past the Azier gates a year ago and taken up residence there ever since. The two girls were twins
    aged eleven, several years younger than the third elf, and one was never without the other. They had identical rosy faces and always dressed in the style
    of rich city ladies, but could be differentiated by the color that crept into their fine, white hair: streaks of blue for one, and tips of purple for the
    other. The only reason anyone confused one for the other was because their names were Zuli and Yuli, and no one could remember which twin was which.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, in the back," Miss Chestnut called to the purple-haired twin. "Your name?"
</p>
<p>
    "Zuli," she said. "I was wondering if we would be discussing the half-elven genocide."
</p>
<p>
    Faenon had thought the room had been silent before, but it sounded now as if the sound had been completely sucked out of it. He glanced at Zuli with wide
    eyes, but she stared at Miss Chestnut unwaveringly even as every other eye in the class was on her.
</p>
<p>
    "The law to which I assume you are referring states that the government gains full custody of any child of mixed descent. This is for the child's best
    interest, because the primary element of the law is to criminalize the intentional conception of a half-elven child, so his or her parents would be
    imprisoned and therefore unable to care for their child," Miss Chestnut said slowly and evenly. "After a thorough outside investigation found that all
    half-elves have been kept in good condition in a private research facility, any public suggestion that the government promotes discriminatory or genocidal
    practices became classified as treason and punishable as such. We will, however, be discussing civic interracial issues."
</p>
<p>
    Zuli was wearing elegant fingerless gloves of a lacy fabric that extended halfway to her elbows. Her fingernails were long and oval, painted a deep purple,
    and she wore a number of shimmering golden rings. Faenon knew this because he was watching her hands rest on the blank notebook she had in front of her.
    Her purple nails were digging deeper and harder into the paper with each word Miss Chestnut said.
</p>
<p>
    "C'mon, don't give us that," he protested, and now all eyes were on him. "You're back in the Plains-the law doesn't mean anything here. Tell us what's
    really going on over there. Don't be afraid to break some rules."
</p>
<p>
    "You would know about breaking rules, wouldn't you, Faenon?" Miss Chestnut retorted, peering at him through narrow eyes.
</p>
<p>
    Faenon turned to Zuli, needing someone to turn to, and muttered loudly, "Damn, she already knows me."
</p>
<p>
    "My colleagues have been kind enough to brief me," she replied.
</p>
<p>
    Faenon knew how to stand tall no matter whom he faced. He had never had a height advantage, but discipline with his great battle axe had always given him
    the advantage in strength. He never liked to admit how hard he worked to become strong; to him, having innate talent was more attractive than putting long
    hours into a skill. He pretended he was as carefree about his axe as he was about everything else. He had a youthful face even for seventeen years: a
    strong but hairless jawline framed by unkempt curls of dirty blonde, with round, brown eyes that twinkled with mischief.
</p>
<p>
    "If there are no further interruptions," continued Miss Chestnut, "I'll continue with my introduction to the course."
</p>
<p>
    "You told us to ask you questions," Faenon pointed out.
</p>
<p>
    "You are not asking questions, Mr. Winter," she returned, but as soon as the words were out of her mouth, she made a sour face, because addressing Faenon
    by his last name allowed the sophistication of its sound to overshadow the intended coldness of the gesture. Mr. Winter was what they called his
    grandfather, who had gone to the outskirts of Azier to build a spacious farm that could feed the village. The name still fit the son, Corona, who followed
    in his father's footsteps and inherited the farm, but it did not suit the grandson, who was born after Winter's death, and who had no intentions of sitting
    on a farm for the rest of his life.
</p>
<p>
    "Wait, I have a question!" called out the third and final Itonami before Faenon could say another word.
</p>
<p>
    Though Faenon didn't like to notice the similarities, he and Raz were much alike. Both were in their last year of school, neither was afraid to redirect a
    lesson plan, and each hated the other's way of doing it. Raz and Faenon avoided conversation as much as possible, but they shared a mutual friend, so they
    had rubbed against each other many times.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes?" Miss Chestnut answered with disdain, not only because of his abrupt interruption, but also because Raz had an appearance that invited disdain.
    Though his cousins Zuli and Yuli had unusually colored hair, as well, his beat theirs out with a bright shade of bubblegum pink, which he attested was,
    like theirs, completely natural. Every day, he wore a patchwork jacket composed of heavily pigmented cotton squares. His posture was one of forced
    perfection, with an upright spine, legs crossed at the ankle, and hands resting gently on the clean, high-quality paper of his notebook, next to which he
    placed his small bottle of ink and his black feather quill. IT'S FROM SOCK. SCREW IT I'M MAKING THEM A THING. Every other student in the school used
    charcoal or graphite pencils.
</p>
<p>
    "Pardon me if this isn't in the curriculum," Raz said, "but where did the word <i>elf</i> come from? In our language, we call ourselves <i>isinni</i>, but
    when we came here, everyone started calling us elves and I have no clue why and neither does anyone else I've ever asked."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Chestnut was stunned into silence by the question. So was the entire class.
</p>
<p>
    Raz slammed his hands on his desk. "Well, shucks, that's the only reason I'm here! This class is worthless," he declared, and he stood up and walked out
    before Miss Chestnut could collect herself.
</p>
<p>
    Incidents like this one were what differentiated Raz and Faenon. When Faenon made a scene, it was for a cause, not for a poorly-timed joke. Raz, he
    thought, just liked the attention.
</p>
<p>
    "Welcome back to Azier," Faenon said to Miss Chestnut with a smirk. "You've gotta deal with me and the drama queen over there for another year."
</p>
<p>
    After stooping over to write a note for Raz's detention as punishment for his cutting class, Miss Chestnut was finally able to continue. "If there are no
    more questions or other interruptions, I'll begin by going over a brief timeline of events," she said. "We'll start at the very beginning, of course, with
    an explanation of the Celestial Event."
</p>
<p>
    Faenon was among the few who did not need a retelling, but his age of seventeen was the highest of the class, and he had been only three when the Celestial
    Event occurred. He was an anomaly for remembering the event at all, because it had happened in the middle of a day in the middle of the week, while almost
    every student and teacher stationed themselves in the underground cellar to hide from the perceived crisis. Uninterested in waiting and curious to see what
    was happening, Faenon slipped out during the confusion.
</p>
<p>
    "Almost fourteen years ago, during the Celestial Event, as it is now called, the paths of our planet and the elven planet all but intersected," she began.
    "The planet suddenly appeared overhead in a span of a day, but rolled on past us just as quickly without threat of collision. It is a smaller, but highly
    magical planet that reacts on proximity to life, and sends biological beings between celestial bodies when they come close enough. When the elven planet
    passed, it sent elves here, to Iraedria."
</p>
<p>
    Along with a companion who was also separated from her class, Faenon had seen two elves arrive firsthand but had shielded his eyes from a bright flash of
    light just as they appeared. His memory lacked that crucial moment of how they came from one world to the next. He did remember that one of the two elves
    fell the six feet to the ground from where he had materialized and scraped himself on the cobblestone path. Incidentally, Azier remembered another
    occurrence on that date that they considered just as significant as the Celestial Event.
</p>
<p>
    "I'll explain the mechanism by which the elven planet operates so that you can understand how this mass transportation of elves occurred," said Miss
    Chestnut. "The elves were familiar with the phenomenon because their planet had a moon that supported life, unlike ours."
</p>
<p>
    Faenon rolled his eyes and rested his cheek on his fist as she continued with the technical explanation about the composition of atmospheres, the perigees
    and apogees of lunar orbits, and the theorized cause of mass teleportation. It became too much to pretend to listen to.
</p>
<p>
    "Is this really important?" he interrupted when she came to the end of a sentence. "We get it. Planets got close, weird magic happened, elves came here.
    Can we move on?"
</p>
<p>
    On Miss Chestnut's face, upset showed more clearly than her now usual derision. "A poll says that the most common question that youth under eighteen have
    about the history of human and elven civilization is how the elves got here," she said in a small voice.
</p>
<p>
"Okay, two things," Faenon said. "One, I'd respect that if your explanation sounded less like a whole lot of 'nobody really knows,' and two, the    <i>real </i>question youth under eighteen have about elves and humans is why it's illegal to have half-elven kids."
